Displays flags on Khan Acadmey programs


V0.1.0 - Adds flag count to general program information on pages dedicated to displaying large lists of programs and updates all information in real time

v0.2.0 - Adds flags under programs


Hopefully updating to add flags in a better format soon. Fixing flag display issues for non browse projects pages and loading additional projects/loading different projects categories
